# Reinforcement Learning 

> A repo that has implementations of starter RL algorithms and problems. All code written from scratch. First tried a multi-armed bandit problem and explored the explore-exploit dilemma. Studied the impact of epsilon on convergence and cumulative reward.
> This is followed by implementations of Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, SARSA and Q-learning for a 3x4 Grid World problem.
